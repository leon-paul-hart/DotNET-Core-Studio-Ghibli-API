# .Net Core Studio Ghibli API + MVC Client

***Inspired by the wonderful work at https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/ by https://github.com/janaipakos/***

I am teaching myself how to build a similar API using .Net Core using the tutorial here :
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio

## High Level Plan

- [ ] Create a CRUD API that uses EntityFrameworkCore to access an SQLite database to store it's data
- [ ] Create an MVC frontend client providing a simple UI to navigate the API in Read Only mode
- [ ] Add user authentication to the MVC application which allows authorised users to use the full CRUD capabilities of the API
- [ ] Use Specflow to create Unit Tests and Integration Tests for both the API and MVC client
